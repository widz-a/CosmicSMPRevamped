# CosmicSMP Revamped Plugin
~~Now that powers dont exist on the main world anymore, I have decided to split it into 2 3 plugins,~~
- ~~**API:** Consists of api stuff blah blah, they do some work that Global and Lore depend on.~~
- ~~**Global:** Codes for command and stuff.~~
- ~~**Lore:** _(Not yet implemented)._ Powers n stuff~~
