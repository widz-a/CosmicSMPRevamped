# CosmicSMP Revamped Plugin
Now that powers dont exist on the main world anymore, I have decided to split it into ~~2~~ 3 plugins,
- **API:** Consists of api stuff blah blah, they do some work that Global and Lore depend on.
- **Global:** Codes for command and stuff.
- **Lore:** _(Not yet implemented)._ Powers n stuff

## Dependency used
- ~~Spigot~~ [Paper](https://papermc.io): Obviously.
- [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/): Deals with packet stuff.
- ~~[WithicalUtilities](): Utilities (Will release when I'm not lazy)~~ haha no longer required suck my d-
- [SuperVanish](https://github.com/LeonMangler/SuperVanish): SuperVanish related features
- [WorldEdit](https://github.com/enginehub/worldedit): /schemtest
- [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/DiscordSRV/DiscordSRV): Send join/leave message when staff uses /vanish
